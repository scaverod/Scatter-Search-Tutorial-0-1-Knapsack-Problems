The challenge is to select a subset of items that maximizes total value while respecting a weight capacity constraint.\n\n## Mathematical Formulation\n\n**Objective:** Maximize total profit of selected items\n$$\\text{Maximize } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i \\cdot x_i$$\n\n**Constraint:** Respect knapsack capacity\n$$\\text{Subject to } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\cdot x_i \\leq W$$\n\n**Variable bounds:** Binary selection\n$$x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$\n\n**Where:**\n- $v_i$ is the profit/value of item $i$\n- $w_i$ is the weight of item $i$\n- $x_i$ is a binary decision variable (1 if item $i$ is selected, 0 otherwise)\n- $W$ is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack\n- $n$ is the total number of available items\n\n## Problem Characteristics\n\nThe 0-1 knapsack problem is:\n- **NP-hard**: No polynomial-time algorithm is known for the general case\n- **Binary**: Each item can be either included or excluded (no fractional selection)\n- **Single constraint**: Only one capacity constraint (extendable to multiple constraints)\n- **Maximization**: Seeks to maximize total value (vs. minimization problems)\n\n## Instance Complexity Factors\n\nThe difficulty of a knapsack instance depends on several factors:\n- **Size (n)**: Number of items available for selection\n- **Capacity tightness**: Ratio of capacity to total weight of all items\n- **Profit correlation**: Relationship between item profits and weights\n- **Optimal solution density**: Number of items in the optimal solution\n\nOur educational instance is designed to demonstrate various algorithmic behaviors while remaining comprehensible for step-by-step analysis."

This dual approach ensures both systematic coverage of the solution space and problem-specific intelligence for the knapsack problem.\n\n### Strategy 1: (h,q) Systematic Toggling Patterns\n\nThis deterministic approach generates solutions using structured bit-flipping patterns based on mathematical sequences:\n\n**Parameters:**\n- **Step size h**: Controls spacing between toggle positions (h = 2, 3, 4, ...)\n- **Phase offset q**: Determines starting positions (q = 1, 2, ..., h)\n\n**Process:**\n1. **Pattern generation**: For each (h,q) pair, toggle positions q-1, q-1+h, q-1+2h, ...\n2. **Dual solutions**: Create both the direct result and its binary complement\n3. **Seed evolution**: Use the last generated solution as the seed for the next pattern\n\n**Mathematical foundation**: This creates solutions with different Hamming distances, ensuring structural diversity across the solution space.\n\n### Strategy 2: Capacity-Aware Random Selection\n\nThis probabilistic approach generates solutions that target the feasible region:\n\n**Process:**\n1. **Capacity estimation**: Calculate `max_items = capacity / average_weight`\n2. **Random variation**: Apply `target_items = max_items ± α` where α is random deviation\n3. **Random selection**: Randomly select `target_items` positions to activate\n4. **Feasibility targeting**: Solutions are designed to be close to (but not necessarily within) capacity constraints\n\n### Algorithm Benefits\n\n**Systematic Coverage**: (h,q) patterns ensure diverse structural patterns across the solution space  \n**Problem Awareness**: Capacity-aware generation targets promising feasible regions  \n**Scalability**: Both methods automatically adapt to any problem size  \n**Diversity Guarantee**: Mathematical foundation ensures solutions differ in predictable ways  \n**Balance**: Combines deterministic structure with stochastic variation  \n\n### Theoretical Background\n\nThe method implements the scatter search diversification principle of generating solutions that are \"scattered\" across the solution space. The (h,q) toggling patterns create solutions with controlled Hamming distances, while capacity-aware selection incorporates problem-specific knowledge.\n\n### References\n- Glover, F.

    "### Didactic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we illustrate the (h,q) toggling process step-by-step with a small problem size for clarity. This demonstration traces how solutions are generated, showing the toggling positions, resulting solutions, and how the seed evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define the size of the problem, we will use `n=10` items and start with an initial seed of all zeros. The example will cover a few (h,q) pairs to illustrate the method clearly. To produce solutions with different size, you can change the value of `n_demo` in the code below."

   "source": "## 2) Two-Phase Improvement Method\n\nThe **Two-Phase Improvement Method** is a fundamental component of Scatter Search that transforms any trial solution (potentially infeasible) into a high-quality, feasible solution using systematic local search. This ensures all solutions in the algorithm meet problem constraints while maximizing solution quality.\n\n### Theoretical Foundation\n\nThe method implements a **greedy repair-and-improve strategy** based on efficiency analysis:\n- **Efficiency metric**: Profit-to-weight ratio guides all decisions\n- **Monotonic improvement**: Each phase guarantees non-decreasing solution quality\n- **Constraint satisfaction**: Phase 1 ensures feasibility, Phase 2 maintains it\n- **Local optimality**: Final solutions are locally optimal with respect to single-item swaps\n\n### Phase 1: Feasibility Repair\n\n**Objective**: Transform infeasible solutions to satisfy the capacity constraint with minimal quality loss\n\n**Algorithm**:\n1. **Efficiency ordering**: Sort items by profit/weight ratio in ascending order (worst efficiency first)\n2. **Selective removal**: For each item in efficiency order:\n   - If solution is still infeasible AND item is currently selected\n   - Remove item (set from 1→0) and update objective value\n   - Stop when solution becomes feasible\n3. **Guaranteed termination**: Continue until feasibility is achieved\n\n**Key Properties**:\n- **Minimal quality loss**: Removes least valuable items first (by efficiency)\n- **Guaranteed feasibility**: Always produces a feasible solution\n- **Efficiency preservation**: Retains highest-efficiency items when possible\n\n### Phase 2: Greedy Improvement\n\n**Objective**: Maximize solution quality while maintaining feasibility constraints\n\n**Algorithm**:\n1. **Efficiency ordering**: Sort items by profit/weight ratio in descending order (best efficiency first)\n2. **Selective addition**: For each item in efficiency order:\n   - If item is not currently selected AND adding it maintains feasibility\n   - Add item (set from 0→1) and update objective value\n3. **Saturation point**: Continue until no more items can be added\n\n**Key Properties**:\n- **Quality maximization**: Adds most valuable items first (by efficiency)\n- **Feasibility preservation**: Never violates capacity constraints\n- **Greedy optimality**: Achieves locally optimal solution for single-item additions\n\n### Implementation Variants\n\n**`repair_solution(pb, x)`**: Applies only Phase 1\n- Use when preserving solution diversity is important\n- Faster execution for applications requiring only feasibility\n- Maintains structural similarity to original solution\n\n**`improve_solution(pb, x)`**: Applies both Phase 1 and Phase 2\n- Use for maximum solution quality\n- Standard choice for most Scatter Search applications\n- Produces locally optimal feasible solutions\n\n**`improvement_trace(pb, x)`**: Records complete optimization trajectory\n- Captures (weight, value) points at each step\n- Essential for visualization and algorithm analysis\n- Useful for understanding improvement dynamics\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n\n- **Time complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for both phases = O(n log n)\n- **Space complexity**: O(n) for solution storage and efficiency arrays\n- **Deterministic**: Always produces the same result for identical inputs\n\n### Strategic Benefits\n\n**Solution Quality**: Transforms arbitrary solutions into high-quality, locally optimal solutions  \n**Constraint Handling**: Guarantees feasibility while preserving solution structure where possible  \n**Algorithm Integration**: Provides consistent, reliable solution improvement for metaheuristics  \n**Educational Value**: Clear, interpretable optimization steps ideal for understanding greedy algorithms"

    "\n",
    "The initial pool **P** contains high-quality, feasible solutions obtained by improving each diversified solution. This pool serves as the foundation for creating the Reference Set and ensures we start with a collection of locally optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Addition Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "When building pool P, the algorithm uses an intelligent dual-phase approach to maximize diversity while maintaining solution quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Phase**: Apply full two-phase improvement (repair + optimize) to each diversified solution\n",
    "2. **Backup Phase**: If full improvement creates duplicates, apply repair-only to the same candidate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distinct solutions only**: Each unique solution appears only once in P\n",
    "- **Quality priority**: Full improvement is attempted first for maximum solution quality\n",
    "- **Diversity fallback**: Repair-only provides alternatives when improvement creates duplicates  \n",
    "- **Target size**: Continue until reaching the specified `PSize` parameter"

    "## 3) Reference Set (RefSet): Balancing Quality and Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Reference Set** is the core memory structure of Scatter Search, maintaining a small collection of elite solutions that balance high quality with structural diversity. This balance is critical for effective search guidance and represents one of the key innovations that distinguishes Scatter Search from other metaheuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "The RefSet implements a **dual-criteria selection strategy** that addresses the fundamental exploration vs. exploitation trade-off in optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality Component**: Ensures the search is guided by the best solutions found, providing **intensification**  \n",
    "**Diversity Component**: Maintains structural variety to prevent premature convergence, providing **diversification**\n",
    "\n",
    "This balance is mathematically controlled by the parameters b (total size) and b1 (quality subset size), allowing fine-tuning of the algorithm's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RefSet Construction Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The RefSet of size `b` is built using a sophisticated two-phase selection approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 1: Quality Component (b1 solutions)\n",
    "- **Selection Criterion**: Rank solutions by objective value, select top b1 unique solutions\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ensures RefSet contains the highest-quality discovered solutions  \n",
    "- **Effect**: Provides **intensification** by focusing search around promising regions\n",
    "- **Duplicate Handling**: Only unique solutions are considered (identical solutions are rejected)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 2: Diversity Component (b2 = b - b1 solutions)\n",
    "- **Selection Criterion**: Maximize minimum Hamming distance to existing RefSet members\n",
    "- **Metric**: Hamming distance = number of differing bit positions between binary vectors\n",
    "- **Algorithm**: Greedy selection of solutions with maximum minimum distance to RefSet\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ensures **structural diversity** and prevents premature convergence\n",
    "- **Effect**: Provides **diversification** by maintaining different solution patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "###  RefSet Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quality Phase**: Add b1 best unique solutions from pool P to RefSet\n",
    "2. **Diversity Phase**: For remaining b2 positions:\n",
    "   - Consider all remaining candidates from pool P (excluding duplicates)\n",
    "   - For each candidate, compute minimum Hamming distance to current RefSet solutions\n",
    "   - Select candidate with **maximum** minimum distance (most structurally different)\n",
    "   - Apply minimum diversity threshold to ensure meaningful structural differences\n",
    "   - Repeat until RefSet reaches target size `b` or no more diverse candidates available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation and Robustness**:\n",
    "- Comprehensive input validation and error handling\n",
    "- Automatic adjustment when insufficient unique solutions are available\n",
    "- Minimum diversity thresholds to ensure meaningful structural differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Properties**:\n",
    "- **Update flags**: Track which solutions are newly added to prioritize them in subset generation\n",
    "- **Replacement mechanism**: New solutions can replace existing ones during search evolution\n",
    "- **Duplicate prevention**: Identical solutions are automatically rejected to maintain diversity\n",
    "- **Quality monitoring**: Real-time statistics on value ranges and diversity measures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis and Monitoring**:\n",
    "- Comprehensive diversity statistics (minimum, maximum, average Hamming distances)\n",
    "- Feasibility analysis of RefSet solutions\n",
    "- Efficiency analysis based on profit/weight ratios\n",
    "- Solution density analysis (number of selected items)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size Selection**: RefSet size `b` is typically small (5-20 solutions) to balance:\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency**: Smaller sets reduce combination generation overhead\n",
    "- **Solution representational power**: Larger sets capture more solution space diversity\n",
    "- **Memory management**: Compact representation for efficient subset operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality/Diversity Balance**: The ratio b1/b balances intensification vs. diversification:\n",
    "- Higher b1/b: More intensification (exploitation of best solutions)\n",
    "- Lower b1/b: More diversification (exploration of diverse solution patterns)\n",
    "- Typical values: b1 = b/2 (balanced) to b1 = 2*b/3 (quality-focused)\n",
    "\n",
    "The RefSet serves as the algorithm's memory, guiding future search while maintaining the structural diversity necessary for effective global optimization."

    "## 4) Subset Generation & 5) Multi-Solution Combination Method\n",
    "\n",
    "These components work together to create new trial solutions by intelligently combining multiple RefSet solutions, extending beyond traditional pairwise combination methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subset Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**: Generate subsets of various sizes from RefSet, prioritizing those containing recently added (\"new\") solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process**:\n",
    "- **Variable sizes**: Subset sizes range from 2 to RefSet size for exploration flexibility\n",
    "- **New solution priority**: Subsets containing at least one recently added solution are generated first\n",
    "- **Complementary subsets**: Additional random subsets ensure comprehensive coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Solution Combination Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Innovation**: Extends traditional two-solution combination to handle arbitrarily sized subsets using a generalized weighted scoring formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted Scoring Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For each variable position `i`, compute a score based on the quality-weighted average:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{score}(i) = \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{subset}} x_i^{(j)} \\cdot \\text{ObjVal}(j)}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{subset}} \\text{ObjVal}(j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: Higher-quality solutions have more influence on each variable's score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trial Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Score computation**: Calculate weighted score for each variable position using the formula above\n",
    "2. **Threshold selection**: Choose random threshold `r ∈ (0,1)` for each trial\n",
    "3. **Binary assignment**: Set `x_i = 1` if `score(i) ≥ r`, else `x_i = 0`\n",
    "4. **Multiple trials**: Generate several trials per subset using different thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalable combination**: Works with 2, 3, or more parent solutions seamlessly\n",
    "- **Quality weighting**: Better solutions contribute more to offspring characteristics\n",
    "- **Increased diversity**: Larger subsets create more varied recombination patterns\n",
    "- **Adaptive exploration**: Variable subset sizes prevent algorithmic stagnation"
